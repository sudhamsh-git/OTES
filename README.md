# ONLINE TRAINING ENHANCEMENT SOLUTION
# Abstract
This project aims to develop a system that unobtrusively observes students in online classrooms to understand and improve learning outcomes. By analyzing student behavior, such as attention span and engagement, we can provide valuable insights to both teachers and students. We believe that improving student engagement can lead to better academic performance.

To achieve this, we are developing an AI system that can track student head movements and body language to assess their level of attention. By comparing student behavior to class averages, we can identify potential issues and provide targeted feedback. This technology has the potential to revolutionize education by offering data-driven guidance for both teachers and students.
